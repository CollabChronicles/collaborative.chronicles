            <h2>World Brief</h2>
            <p>This world is inspired by mythology and explores the real-world issue of cultural preservation. Myths and legends are literally fading from memory, and characters must navigate a world where ancient stories, beings, and ways of life are at risk of being forgotten. </p>

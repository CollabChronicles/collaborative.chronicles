            <h2>World Brief</h2>
            <p>This world is inspired by mythology and explores the real-world issue of cultural preservation. In this setting, myths and legends are literally fading from memory, and characters must navigate a world where ancient stories are at risk of being forgotten. Writers are invited to create characters, locations, and lore that fit naturally within this world.</p>

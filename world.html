            <h2>World Brief</h2>
          This world draws inspiration from mythology and folklore, exploring the real-world issue of cultural preservation through a fantastical lens. Across lands both familiar and strange, myths and legends are not merely stories. They are living things, sustained by memory, belief, and retelling. Now, those memories are thinning.

Ancient tales are slipping from collective consciousness. Gods go unnamed. Spirits fade. Sacred places lose their meaning as the stories that once defined them are forgotten. Some beings weaken while others exploit the forgetting. Some may try to resist the forgetting, and unfortunate others disappear entirely. A few adapt in unexpected ways. 

Characters and stories may be of mortals, immortals, storytellers, spirits, legendary beasts, and everything in between. We ask writers to consider this question: when myths and legends start to disappear, what happens to a world and its inhabitants
            ?
            
Writers are free to explore this world in any tone or style that feels true to them. However, all content should remain PG-13 in language and subject matter. We want this collaborative world to be accessible and shareable with a wide audience.

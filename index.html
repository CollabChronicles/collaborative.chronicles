            <h2>About Collaborative Chronicles</h2>
            <p>Collaborative Chronicles is a place for writers to build thoughtful fictional worlds together. Each project draws inspiration from a genre of storytelling and a real-world issue, and culminates in a published anthology supporting a related charity. Contributors are encouraged to engage deeply with the world and create original characters and lore that truly belong to it.</p>
            <p><em>We value stories that are clear without being obvious, and meaningful without being opaque.</em></p>

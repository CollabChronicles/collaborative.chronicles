            <h2>What We Hope to Do</h2>
            <p>This project is just starting out, but here are the key actions we want to take to accomplish our goals</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gather writers from the internet to build a themed fictional world together</li>
                <li>Once we collect enough submissions, create an anthology of the collected work</li>
                <li><strong>We will share this first anthology as a free ebook</strong><li>
                <li>On subsequent runs, based on response to this first anthology:<li>
                <li>Publish and sell the anthologies electronically (most likely on Kindle Direct Publishing)</li>
                <li>Donate 100% of the proceeds (royalties - estimated taxes) to a charity helping the real-world problem linked to the theme of the world</li>
                <li>Create a community that allows writers to create collaborative, thoughtful, and meaningful work</li>
                <li>Plan, collect writing, and create these anthologies cyclically</li>
                <li>If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out! -- collaborativechroniclesproject@gmail.com</li>
            </ul>

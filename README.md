# collaborative.chronicles
Collaborative Chronicles is a place for writers to build thoughtful fictional worlds together. Each project draws inspiration from a storytelling genre and a real-world issue, and culminates in a published anthology supporting a related charity. We ask contributors to engage deeply with the world and create work that feels intentional and alive.
